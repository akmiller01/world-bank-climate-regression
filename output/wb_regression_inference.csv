Since the global financial and economic crises, the Government of Tuvalu (GoT) has progressed on substantive reforms while gradually rebuilding its fiscal buffers. Tuvalu’s economy is highly vulnerable to challenges stemming from its very small size and geographic isolation, and relies heavily on grants and buffer assets to absorb shocks. Tuvalu’s buffer assets in the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) supported the GoT in weathering the recent global financial crisis (GFC). Over the past 3 years, the GoT has gradually rebuilt the CIF back to its sustainable level through a mixture of expenditure restraint, higher revenues and additional budget support from donors including two budget support operations from the World Bank. In parallel, the GoT has progressed on a number if reforms, including improving public financial management (PFM) and social service delivery. The GoT, with the support of the donor community, has taken a series of steps in response to the disaster, but will need additional financing for the recovery efforts. Subsequent support provided to the affected communities included construction materials, medicines, and tools to assist with the clean-up of storm debris.

Schools and hospitals were damaged or destroyed and key social services were severely disrupted. Major infrastructure including roads, railroads, electricity generation and transmission, potable water and sewage facilities were utterly destroyed. The origin of the conflict is largely blamed on the exclusion and marginalization of a large part of the Liberia population from political power and the economic wealth from the country's natural resources. Poor economic governance and weak public financial management in particular allowed public resources to be utilized for the benefit a small group of political elite which heightened inequality and social instability.

 Reforms implemented in Morocco since the turn of the century paved the way for 20 years of economic expansion and social progress. Starting in 2009, social and economic progress in Morocco experienced a slowdown, caused by structural limitations in the development model and external shocks, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Challenges include low efficiency in public investment and slow private sector transformation, leading to modest growth compared with countries with similar levels of investment. Morocco attracted foreign direct investment (FDI), but domestic investment remained limited, hindering inclusive growth. The government responded with the New Development Model (NDM), which aims to spur inclusive growth, improve public services, and reduce disparities by 2035. The NDM, which is being operationalized in the 2021–26 agenda of the Government of Morocco (GoM) prioritizes public sector efficiency, private sector promotion, and human capital development. To boost long-term growth and foster a more sustainable and inclusive future, Morocco must enhance the effectiveness of the state’s role as an economic enabler. Doing so involves (i) improving the efficient management of public assets, (ii) enhancing the quality of the enabling environment for private investment and (iii) setting clear and predictable boundaries for the state’s involvement in commercial markets. Better managing the size, performance, and governance frameworks of Morocco’s state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector is at the core of the Kingdom’s transition toward a reduced and more effective role of the state in the economy and more private sector–driven investment, as highlighted in the NDM.",0.024570307,0.020477843,0.018689677

The Program Development Objective of the  Swachh Bharat Mission Support Operation ( SBMSO) is to:  to reduce open defecation in rural areas, and strengthen MDWS capacity to manage the national SBM-G program. India has been one of the fastest growing economies during the last decade. Between 2004 and 2011, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded at a rate of 8.3 percent per year while poverty declined by an average of 2.5 percentage points per year, a pace significantly faster than earlier periods. Poverty reduction was supported by higher economic growth and greater responsiveness of poverty to growth, including through the expansion of social programs. Increases in non-farm wage employment, especially in construction, greater rural-urban integration, and higher rural wage growth were amongst the key drivers. However, in the more recent period since 2012, a slowdown in rural real wage growth and volatility in construction activity may have had a sobering effect on the pace of poverty reduction. At the same time, acceleration of growth to 7.3 percent in 2015, if sustained, may lead to further gains for the poor. Maintaining the growth momentum, and increasing the responsiveness of poverty reduction to growth, is an India’s key challenge going forward. The overall experience of the past national sanitation programs offer several lessons. First, eliminating OD will not be achieved through a top-down approach of constructing toilets. Instead, it needs to be driven by changing behavior at the community level. This requires complementary ‘soft’ interventions such as interpersonal communication of hygiene messages. Second, the implementation of SBM-G is being conducted by the states, and therefore the role of MDWS is to support states with allocation of funds and incentives for achievement of programs goals and objectives. This role is proposed to be expanded to provide additional capacity building and technical support to the implementing institutions in the states. Third, by recognizing and incentivizing good performance of states and their implementing agencies, especially GPs, fiscal programs should intelligently provide incentives to those implementing the program and who are key facilitators in achieving and sustaining the success of SBM-G. In order to implement an operation of national scale, a hybrid operation is proposed using two lending instruments: (a) Program for Results (PforR), for results orientation and supporting the incentive component of the national program; and (b) Investment Project Financing (IPF), for program management and capacity building at the national level.",0.13058206,0.019259611,0.08216865

The E3 MPA has two components: component 1, financing the scale-up of EE investments and component 2, policy and regulatory reforms and other enabling activities. Investments under component 1 would result in projected lifetime energy savings and projected lifetime net GHG emissions (prDO-level indicator 2 and corporate scorecard indicator). Activities under component 2 will result in adoption/amendment of policies and regulations to scale up and sustain energy savings (PrDO-level indicator 3). These policy reforms would provide some energy savings during the E3 MPA’s implementation period and pave the way for scaled-up impacts in the years ahead. Moreover, enabling activities under component 2 will also help address many of the policy, financial, informational, and other barriers noted earlier; thus, the programmatic nature of the MPA will better enable the gradual and systematic scale-up of EE investments and private capital mobilized or enabled (PCM/PCE) over time. Energy savings would also enable reduced energy imports and fossil fuel use, reduced global and local emissions, increased economic productivity and jobs, contributing to low-carbon, resilient development.",0.9699354,0.01346886,0.8823843

The development objectives of the Relief, Recovery and Resilience Development Policy Financing Cambodia are structured around three strategic pillars: (i) continuing to provide timely and targeted relief to the affected population; (ii) facilitating robust recovery through structural reforms; and (iii) building resilience against future economic shocks. Actions to provide timely and targeted relief include scaling up of social assistance measures and improving financing for small and medium enterprises. Actions to facilitate robust recovery through structural reforms include improving trade facilitation and the business environment. And actions to build resilience against future economic shocks include better public finance management, greater efficiency of Cambodia’s banking sector, and greater efficiency of revenue collection. These pillars are mutually reinforcing. Pillars 1 and 2 support structural reforms to help shorten the recovery time and to make the recovery process more inclusive, while several of the actions in Pillar 1 will inform longer term recovery, not just relief.

 The development objective of the Local Governance and Services Improvement Program for Result Project for West Bank and Gaza is to strengthen the local government financing system and improve local service delivery in program villages. The program introduces the allocation of transparent and predictable fiscal transfers to VCs to finance implementation of participatory investment plans. The Program also intends to provide further incentives for local accountability by allocating fiscal transfers directly to large VCs, making JSCs responsible to plan for service cost recovery in the medium-to-long term, and supporting LG sector consolidation. Hence, the program will strengthen institutional systems and capacities of larger VCs so that they can be categorized as municipalities in the near future or evolve to become the center of a village cluster. For the small and low capacity VCs, the program will support strengthening the role of JSCs as an execution and service delivery entity to generate economies of scale and ensure long-term financial sustainability. At the same time, strong governance arrangements would ensure clear accountability between the JSC, member VCs and citizens. Hence, LGSIP would be selective and will apply minimum criteria that VCs and JSCs will need to meet to become eligible.

During the course of the year the Government will update their National Plan (PRSP).  This operation will align with measures identified in the revised plan.  It will also build on the 2010 Economic Recovery DPO, by focusing mostly on policy measures that will sustain economic growth, maintain comptitiveness, and improve the investment climate for Government of Moldova to achieve their broader vision of increased trade and integration with the Europena Union.  The design of the operation will be based on findings of AAA work within the Bank and IFC, notably the CEM, Doing Business, DTIS, and the BEEPS.
 
 To generate competitiveness, a main emphasis of the operation will be on improving the investment climate to generate productivity gains.  Proposed polciy measures and policy dialogue under the operation will build on firm-level producitvity regressions undertaken under the CEM to identify the main investment climate impacts on productivity.  This work will be undertaken in collaboration with IFC's Investment Climate Advisory Services and Doing Business Teams.
 
 In addition to growth and competitiveness, the operation will consider measures necessary to increase savings for new investment. Public sector measures will aim to generate fiscal space for much needed infrastrcuture investments, whilst aiming to correct the structural fiscal deficit.  Provate sector measures will focus on improving the development impact of remittances by attracting more of the remittance flow into the formal banking system and improving intermediation.  These measures will be informed by the Bank's recent and on-going work under Public Expenditure Reviews and financial sector TA. The development objective of the Competitiveness Development Policy Operation Program is to improve competitiveness and thereby increase the volume of Moldovan exports, especially in European Union (EU) markets; and improve access to finance thereby promoting investment-led growth. This program document presents a Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (DPO) for an amount of US$30 million. This is a single operation supporting the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Moldova to enhance growth through export competitiveness and increased access to finance. The Government's program for the period 2011-2014 represents a transition from the stabilization and recovery agenda to establishing a strong basis for growth driven by investment, innovation and competitiveness. The operation builds on and deepens the growth and trade-oriented structural reform agenda started under the economic recovery development policy operation, which was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 24, 2010. The Government of the Republic of Moldova has an opportunity to implement reforms that would put the economy on a more sustainable export-led growth path. Emerging from the global economic crisis, Moldova's economic growth resumed swiftly in 2010 and 2011; however, the current Euro area crisis is likely to result in a slowdown of growth in 2012 and in the medium term. Moreover, despite the recovery in 2010 and 2011, job creation remained weak. The main driver of growth in 2010-2011 was private consumption, suggesting that the economy could be returning to the pre-crisis pattern of growth. Before the crisis, a decade of growth with weak job creation created a vicious cycle of migration, remittances, exchange rate appreciation, declines in tradable sectors, joblessness, and thus more migration. Heavy reliance on remittance-funded consumption and housing construction leaves the economy vulnerable to changes in the external environment and undermines Moldova's long-term competitiveness. The operation addresses binding constraints to economic growth by improving the returns to private investment and reducing the costs of finance.",0.02601846,0.0027064579,0.06644353

After a successful episode of implementing the Palestinian Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP 2008-2010), the caretaker government put forward the new National Development Plan (NDP 2011-2013). Under the earlier PRDP 2008-2010, the caretaker government set out towards restoring the basic operating systems of the PA while reforming and creating stronger public institutions that will form the basis of a future Palestinian state. The current NDP 2011-2013 aims to move the PA fiscal and institutional performance beyond recovery and towards sustainability, by gradually reducing dependence on foreign assistance while continuing to improve the welfare of citizens. In February 2011 the PA cabinet resigned with the expectation of formation of a new cabinet within five weeks. This did not happen and the existing cabinet has continued in an acting capacity. On May 4, 2011, the PA in the West Bank signed a reconciliation agreement with the leadership in Gaza, calling for the formation of an interim unity government and announcing a plan to hold national elections by 2012.",-0.04272691,-0.047560267,0.019204415

There are three components to the project, the first component being expansion and improvement of the school grants program. All schools with primary students currently supported by government budget funding are eligible for participation in the school grants program. Expansion of the program, therefore, will mean increasing the size of annual operating grants to schools from approximately US$250, US$400 and US$500 per school for small, medium and large schools, respectively, to targets of US$900, US$1,200 and US$1,800 per school, respectively, over a four year period.

The wave of democratization that the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has experienced since the start of the Arab Spring has also reached Morocco, although its experience has been a reasonably peaceful one with social demonstrations taking place regularly across the country during 2011 and only sporadic outbursts of violence noted. This social movement started with calls for political change, a curbing of corruption and a more inclusive development process. In March 2011, the King of Morocco proposed a broad and comprehensive package of political reforms that were approved in a constitutional referendum held on July 1, 2011. The new constitution sets the basis for a more open and democratic society, provides mechanisms for the construction of a modern state of law and institutions, and lays the foundation for extended regionalization. These changes have followed on the heels of other reforms already undertaken since the current King came to power. Successive national governments have overseen an impressive political, economic and social transformation, with a marked acceleration of structural reforms in recent years. Sound macroeconomic management has produced solid foundations, and the country was on a recovery path from the stagnation of the 1990s when a series of adverse external shocks hit the economy, starting with the 2008 financial crisis.

The development objective of the  Clean Energy Development Project is to assist Colombia in increasing electricity generation capacity from non-conventional renewable energy sources and energy savings in the industrial sector, through mobilization of private investment. The Project consists of one or more IBRD Guarantees in an aggregate amount of up to USD 4118 million and a Clean Technology Fund (CTF) Guarantee in an amount of up to USD 40 million to backstop Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional (FDN’s) payment obligations. The key rationale for IBRD and CTF Guarantees is to help, through FDN, the Republic of Colombia (ROC) in establishing a long-term and creditworthy offtake market, thereby building a track record for long term investments in clean energy. FDN will explore two main functions to catalyze the market for small scale renewable energy generation and energy efficiency initiatives. The first function involves designing and developing credit enhancement and risk mitigation products to help mobilize long term financing for clean energy sector. The second function involves reviewing the potential for implementation of an aggregation vehicle to reduce transaction costs and attract commercial financing for small scale Sub-projects. It is important to note that support to small scale renewables (behind the meter) and energy efficiency are considered only as pilot activities that seek to plant the seeds to demonstrate the implementation potential for further development of the market. Under the PER Account, FDN will create two windows to provide IBRD/CTF Eligible Financial Products, one for Large Scale Renewable Energy (LSRE) Sub-projects and the other for Small Scale Subprojects (SSE) Sub-projects. IBRD and CTF Guarantees support FDN in offering cost effective IBRD/CTF Eligible Financial Products and in obtaining additional leverage. The innovative and efficient approach to structuring the CTF Guarantee to function as a liquidity reserve helps FDN to restore its minimum regulatory core capital ratio requirements. If drawn, CTF Guarantees are expected to be repaid and reinstated. While IBRD and CTF Guarantees are used to backstop FDN’s payment obligations under IBRD/CTF Eligible Financial Products, the trigger events for IBRD and CTF Guarantees are also linked to the overall financial strength of FDN. Overall, the benefits of IBRD and CTF Guarantees are multifold: i) enhance the creditworthiness and overall bankability to help create a long term offtake market for clean energy in Colombia; ii) support initial phases of the Sub-projects to build a track record for the clean energy sector; iii) backstop FDN’s payment obligations to eligible Beneficiaries; iv) if approved, optimize capital allocation for FDN through the specialized regulatory treatment (which would facilitate offering cost effective financial products), and v) leverage public resources, while keeping the IBRD guarantee call as a last report.The Project benefits from a CTF Project Preparation Grant (CTF PPG) to support FDN developing the activities and assessments necessary to develop a pipeline of Sub-projects and to build the capacity of FDN.

This program document proposes a Development Policy Operation (DPO) in support of the Kyrgyz Government’s reforms to strengthen macro‐fiscal foundations for growth, enhance transparency and anti‐corruption in the public sector and boost private sector competitiveness. The operation is in the amount of US$24 million equivalent, split equally between IDA credit and IDA grant. The DPO program squarely backs the government priorities as expressed in its medium‐term plan ‘Unity, Trust, Creation’, 2018‐2022, unveiled in 2018. The proposed program builds on the previous DPO series, which also aimed to enhance public sector governance and improve the business environment, while adding a new focus on fiscal management, particularly in light of growing macroeconomic imbalances, and the manifest need for coherent macroeconomic policy planning to support medium‐term objectives. The operation will support the country’s endeavors to reduce its vulnerability to climate change risks and natural disasters through expanded internet connectivity, which is a critical foundation for effective mitigation. Thus, it is fully in line with past and planned Bank‐Government strategic objectives in the country, as well as with corporate priorities. The Kyrgyz authorities recognize these challenges and are committed to addressing structural impediments to more sustainable and inclusive growth. The new government, ushered‐in following the elections of October 2017, has adopted a development roadmap for the medium‐term that accords high priority to addressing governance issues in a wide range of areas (from economic management to public services delivery), while also emphasizing the need for coordinated initiatives to leverage growth opportunities in key sectors of the economy, encourage digitalization of the economy, and promote spatially balanced economic development. The plan serves as a vehicle to implement the country’s long-term development vision embodied in Vision 2040. Considering heightened fiscal imbalances, including as a result of pre‐electoral slippages and adverse exogenous developments, the new government has also committed to strengthening fiscal management, an ambition that this operation supports. Building on the government’s reform efforts and strategic priorities, the DPO has three pillars, covering reforms to strengthen macro‐fiscal foundations for growth, enhance transparency and anti‐corruption in the public sector and boost private sector competitiveness. Pillar one aims to help the authorities strengthen fiscal discipline, through measures to increase revenues in the short run, but also to anchor fiscal policy more sustainably in the context of a sound fiscal rule. Pillar two seeks to enhance transparency and anti‐corruption in the public sector, through reforms to strengthen public sector integrity, and improve the value for money of public procurement. Pillar three aims to boost private sector competitiveness, through measures to facilitate trade, improve the business environment, and promote greater digital connectivity.

The selected economic sectors include Energy, Transport and Logistics, and Manufacturing (with a focus on ‘Made in Rwanda’ products such as construction materials, light manufacturing and agro-processing).     Building skills to advance the country’s economic agenda is a key priority of the GoR’s ongoing Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy-2 (EDPRS 2) launched in 2013. EDPRS 2 builds on the country’s Vision 2020 which seeks to transform the country by raising its per capita GDP to middle-incomelevel by 2020. The Program is grounded in the Government of Rwanda’s (GoR) National Employment Programs (NEP) approved by Cabinet in 2014. NEP was designed to address the employment challenges in Rwanda and equip its population with the skills required to supporteconomic development.     The main results areas of the operation are: (i) reinforcing governance of the skills development system; (ii ensuring provision of quality training programs with market relevance; (iii) expanding opportunities for continuous upgrading ofjob-relevant skills for sustained employability; and (iv) capacity building for implementation.

These areas are further grouped into three themes: Theme 1: Accelerating economic growth that is private-sector driven and job-creating; Theme 2: Improving the productivity and incomes of the poor through rural development and social protection; and Theme 3: Supporting accountable governance through Public Financial Management (PFM) and decentralization. Specifically, the proposed operation, which aims to improve skills for job opportunities, supports theme 1 and 2. The proposed operation is also aligned with the World Bank’s Africa Region strategic focus (high quality human capital), and complements other IDA-financed projects in Rwanda such as the current Electricity Sector Strengthening Project, the Urban Development Project , and the Transformation of the Agriculture Sector Program.The World Bank is uniquely placed to support the GoR through this operation given it has supported SDPs across the world over the past twenty years and has undertaken detailed reviews and impact evaluations of different interventions. By supporting an existing program, the operation offers a comprehensive package to establish a system that is demand-responsive, focusing on quality and relevance but also considering access for all Rwandans.

The Program Development Objective of the proposed second single tranche PBG II is to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and public financial management, strengthen pension and health systems and improve social inclusion and targeting of social assistance. In addition, the proposed PBG II would provide incremental market access by helping Macedonia in preserving continued market access at reasonable terms and expanding the borrower's name in the financial market over the medium term. It is expected that the PBG II would improve Macedonia's borrowing terms considerably. The development objective of the Public Expenditure Policy Based Guarantee (PEPBG) Program for The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) is to improve the efficiency of public expenditures by strengthening public financial management practices; improving the efficiency of service provision in the health sector; and strengthening social protection and inclusion. This PEPBG states a guarantee in the amount of EUR155 million (US$201.5 million equivalent) in support of a commercial loan to the FYR Macedonia. The single tranche operation supports reforms to improve the efficiency of public expenditures and public financial management, to strengthen health systems, and to improve the targeting of social assistance and social inclusion. The PEPBG will help the FYR Macedonia access international financial markets to address an expected financing gap in 2013. In the current difficult financial environment, a partially-secured financing structure would facilitate FYR Macedonia's access to market funding at a longer tenor and under more favorable terms than would otherwise be possible. Beyond the current turmoil, the PEPBG will help FYR Macedonia preserve continued market access at reasonable terms, expand over the medium-term its name in the international financial market and help the domestic financial market to develop.

The objective of the Guangxi Poverty Reduction Program-for-Results Project for China is to enhance the impact and efficiency of the Guangxi Consolidated Poverty Reduction Program (CPRP) in the Targeted Counties. The Chinese government has established a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy to achieve the goals of the 13th 5YP. Central to this strategy are two institutional innovations which have the potential to provide important global lessons to other countries. The first is accurately targeting poverty households and villages through the establishment of the National Poverty Registration Systemin 2013. The NPRS is a census of poor villages and people in China (about 70 million at its inception), which timely tracks characteristics of the poor and their main causes of poverty. The database is closely integrated into the reporting, prioritization, and accountability lines running upward from the village, county, region, and national levels. It provides critical information from the annual assessments of which households or villages have exited poverty, are at risk of falling back into poverty, or face challenges exiting from poverty. It thus plays a key role in both the identification of the remaining poor and the monitoring of programs to eradicate poverty. Secondly, since 2016, China has introduced the concept of decentralization of poverty reduction efforts with the aim to empower county governments to achieve their poverty targets. It consolidates many earmarked poverty reduction funds into a program-based budgeting system tailored to local context. The designated poverty counties have now been put fully in the driver’s seat for achieving poverty reduction goals. Nevertheless, the program development and implementation remains to be a challenge for the county governments, which face human resources capacity constraints. The Program for Results operation (PforR) enhances these institutional the NPRS database, and aligns fiscal inputs with results by introducing improved planning, budgeting and monitoring systems for poverty programs in Guangxi. It also aims to help to improve the monitoring of poverty reduction programs in one of the most impoverished regions of the country. The lessons from adopting these innovations in Guangxi can serve as learning experience to similar complex settings in the rest of the world and will help the WBG in supporting other countries eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.",0.105958484,0.10119166,0.028928338

Within the second pillar,reforms focus on reducing gas flaring, expanding gas-to-power generation, and reducing electricity subsidies. The third pillar tackles the lack of transparency among financial and non-financial SOEs. The country is at a dangerous crossroads not just for the security of its people but also for the stability of the region. Since at least the early 1980s Iraq has been in a continuous state of conflict or fragility such as the war with Iran (1980-88), the Gulf war of 1990-91, the 2003 war, widespread acts of terrorism since 2003, and the 2006-08 Sunni insurgency. Between 2003 and 2012, 182,000 people were killed by violent means. Iraq was slowly emerging from this long and protracted institutional transition and political instability that had also weakened institutional capacity and the state’s ability to deliver on its social contract with the Iraqi people. As a result, the country is persistently ranked around or below the 10th percentile globally based on indicators of government effectiveness, rule of law, and control of corruption. Amid this already vulnerable situation, Iraq has been hit by the ISIS insurgency. This has caused a quadrupling of violent deaths compared to 2009-12, adding 42,000 to the violent death count, and causing a loss of control of about one-third of the territory to the insurgency. This Development Policy Financing (DPF) seeks to safeguard economic stability and basic service delivery.

Iraq urgently needs support to help sustain the economy and protect the delivery of basic services to the Iraqi population while the government starts undertaking needed reforms. The DPF is built around three pillars, which are also its Program Development Objectives (PDOs), namely to improve: (1) expenditure management; (2) sustainability of energy supply; and (3) transparency of SOEs.

The development objectives of the State of Goias Sustainable Recovery Development Policy Financing in Brazil are to support the State of Goias in: (i) improving fiscal sustainability; and (ii) adopting climate-smart, resilient, and inclusive policies for its agricultural sector. The first pillar of this Development Policy Financing (DPF) supports the fiscal recovery of Goias through the adoption of a spending cap, by consolidating spending on pensions, and the adoption of a medium-term fiscal adjustment plan. Goias is in the process of adopting a strong set of fiscal reforms and is committing to additional targets to ensure a fiscal recovery. An expenditure ceiling rule will help contain recurrent spending growth. A pension reform that increases the minimum retirement age and increases the contribution rate is expected to reduce the pension deficit by almost 20 percent. With these reforms, the DPF will help Goiás in becoming eligible for the federal government’s fiscal adjustment instrument for states (named “Fiscal Recovery Regime” - FRR), building further on the expected results of this DPF. The FRR places Goias under a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan to improve its creditworthiness in the medium-term, increase its access to credit and federal guarantees, and improve the profile of its debt portfolio through additional fiscal consolidation measures. It thus enables this stand-alone DPF to contribute to keeping the State’s public finances on track in the medium-term. The second pillar supports the State of Goias in adopting climate-smart, resilient and inclusive policies for its agricultural sector. It helps steer Goias’ agricultural sector towards climate-smart practices, including the adoption of the State Plan to address climate mitigation and adaptation.

It aims to encourage private sector led investment, by reforming in particular the human development sectors. The Reengagement and Reform Support Grant Program for Guinea aims to support authorities' efforts to consolidate recent democratic gains, and engage decisively on a reform program that would enhance macro-economic stability and mark a clean break with the past on executive accountability and transparency. While the grant would primarily translate into facilitating arrears clearance to International Development Association (IDA) to allow resumption of Bank's disbursement in support of the transitional poverty reduction strategy, particular attention is given to policy actions aimed at: (i) improving public financial management; (ii) strengthening public sector efficiency and accountability focusing on core personnel management systems and; (iii) fostering transparency in the mining sector. The proposed operation is fully aligned with the Bank's Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for Guinea for the period 2011-12, and with the World Bank's Africa action plan. Given the quick response needed to an emergency situation, the operation does not fully address certain design considerations, per OP 8.60. Deficiencies in economic data due to the deterioration of statistical systems and the impact of the political instability make it difficult to present a reliable analysis of the recent economic developments in Guinea as well medium-term prospects. However, it is clear that since 2008, economic performance in Guinea has deteriorated significantly. Cumulatively, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita declined by 4.6 percent between 2008 and 2010. While agriculture continued to grow modestly, the mining sector historically a major driver of growth contracted in real terms by 6 percent between 2008 and 2010 in spite of rising world prices. The regulatory business environment worsened with the cancellations of contracts in the mining sector, changes of license terms and conditions in the telecommunications sector, and more generally, uncertain political situation in the context of deteriorated security.",-0.054414976,-0.042042647,-0.029785402

Bhutan is one of the smallest but fastest-growing economies in the world with an annual average growth rate of 7.6 percent over the past three decades. This stellar growth performance has helped improve living standards and has contributed to poverty reduction. However, further welfare improvements will require a dynamic job-creating private sector. The current hydropower driven growth model has created some macroeconomic imbalances and coupled with a large and dominant public sector, impeded the development of a vibrant private sector. As a result, the economy has witnessed considerable volatility, and limited job creation. This DPC series will help the government address some of these challenges by supporting reforms aimed at improving the management of macroeconomic volatility, strengthening domestic resource mobilization, and promoting employment opportunities in the private sector. The DPC series is also consistent with Bhutan’s 11th (2013-18) and 12th Five-Year Plans (FYP) (2018-23). To support the government of Bhutan address these challenges, the proposed series aims to strengthen the policy framework to improve fiscal management and enhance policies to promote private sector employment opportunities in Bhutan. The proposed operations are structured around two pillars. The first pillar focuses on actions that strengthen macroeconomic management, domestic resource mobilization and public financial management. This will also contribute to a more stable financial sector that is better able to achieve the objective of the second pillar, which seeks to increase access to finance, for MSMEs. In addition, the second pillar is also targeting to: (a) help unlock employment opportunities in the tourism, agriculture and MSMEs (‘cottage and small industries’); and (b) seek to create a more efficient education sector which will help to develop the skills that Bhutan’s private sector is seeking.
