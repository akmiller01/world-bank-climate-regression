The previous programmatic series was interrupted due to a breach of the International Development Association (IDA) Non-Concessional Borrowing Policy (NCBP).1 STP has addressed this problem by changing the terms of the loan it contracted with Angola to comply with the NCBP. The previous series, however, could not be resumed since more than 24 months had elapsed after Board approval of the last operation. A stand-alone development policy operation (DPO) was attempted in 2015, but a potential debt arising from a Memorandum of Understanding signed with a Chinese company prevented the World Bank from going forward. This issue has also been satisfactorily resolved. During this period, the country also signed a revised Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in July 2015, which anchors the short-term fiscal consolidation efforts and includes structural benchmarks on financial stability and measures to address the fiscal imbalance coming from the energy sector. The objective of this operation is to help the Government introduce growth-enabling reforms in the financial sector, business environment, and infrastructure; generate fiscal resources and savings; and improve quality of expenditures. A key focus of government policy is to reduce the dependence on government spending and facilitate the development of alternative growth drivers. This operation will help facilitate this shift by supporting policies that are aimed to address the risks to growth both directly and indirectly. The first pillar of the operation focuses on policies aimed to deal with direct risks to growth such as inadequate frameworks for credit operations and unreliable energy supply. The second pillar brings together policies that will indirectly help mitigate risks to growth. For example, by supporting better SOE surveillance, it is expected that the management of the energy company will improve and thus reduce energy cost and increase reliability of supply.",-0.0016263267,0.004903416,-0.0014747676

The objective of the Investing in Social Protection for Inclusion, Resilience, and Efficiency (INSPIRE) Project is to: (i) contribute to the sustainable provision of social assistance to vulnerable groups, and (ii) improve the coverage and efficiency of selected social safety net programs. There is one component to the project, the first component being provision of social assistance to vulnerable groups. This component will finance the selected 29 types of social benefits envisaged by five state budget programs from January 2023 to June 2024. These benefits provide support to around 2.4 million beneficiaries (individuals), including vulnerable families and children, adults and children with disabilities and caregivers, social pensioners, socially vulnerable students, and victims of human trafficking and the Chornobyl nuclear disaster. Before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the GoU made notable progress in strengthening the targeting of these programs and introduced means testing as an eligibility rule for several of them. The ongoing war in Ukraine exacerbates vulnerabilities and heightened economic, social, and health risks for the beneficiaries of these programs, and most of them rely on monthly social payments as their only income source to cover basic needs. Hence, sustaining the GoU’s capacity to provide social assistance under selected programs during the war is critical, particularly given these groups’ growing vulnerability to ensure their food security and safety. The estimated budget allocated by the GoU for these types of benefits for 2023 is US1 billion dollars equivalent. The project will finance expenditures on 29 selected social benefits paid through the MoSP and PFU to eligible beneficiaries (households or individuals) in compliance with the program rules and procedures outlined in the applicable laws and regulations during the 2023 calendar year and in January to June 2024.

Reinforcing the policy, institutional, and financial foundations of the digital economy. Under the program, Government reforms have already achieved some significant advances, fully in line with the World Bank Group’s (WBG) approach to Maximizing Financing for Development (MFD).In the Energy sector, with an aim of reducing the electricity costs through a cheaper and cleaner energy generation mix, the first DPF in the series (DPF 1) supported the adoption of the Strategic Electricity Generation Master Plan implemented by Independent Private Producers (IPPs) and further operationalized, under the second DPF (DPF 2), through an ambitious mid- and downstream gas-to-power strategy, which includes competitively procured infrastructure and appropriate arrangements for third party access. To further reduce costs and leverage private investment in the sector, the program promotes the institutional transformation of the state-owned utility into a commercially-oriented, financially resilient and credit-worthy company by establishing a focused performance contract with the Government and reinforcing its Board with independent directors. In parallel, to foster electricity access in rural areas, the program supports the Government’s public-private partnership (PPP) model by way of a sustainable tariff reform and expansion of the rural concession coverage. In the ICT sector, with an ultimate objective of increasing Internet penetration rate and lowering costs, the reforms, under DPF 1, allowed the entry of three new Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and, under DPF 2, has led to the adoption of a new Telecom Law and accompanying legal provisions that significantly enhance and modernize the regulatory environment, rendering it conducive to fair competition and private sector investment. Under DPF 2, the Program further supports decisions to strengthen the regulation of market dominant players, the opening of the critical 4G market, and new PPP arrangements to facilitate access of private operators to the vast but underused state-owned fiber optic network. In the DE sector, the program aims to improve the enabling environment for a competitive private sector start-ups ecosystem by increasing proactiveness of Government institutions in using digital technologies, including recent improvements in the coverage of e-taxation and e-payments, and a participatory process to create dedicated start-up regulation in Senegal.",0.0018076869,-0.0009486936,0.0047396603

The proposed operation is the first in a series of two operations. The series builds on three pillars of policy reforms. The first pillar supports the Bank of Guyana’s (BOG’s) ability to manage financial stress including establishing a deposit insurance scheme. The second pillar supports both regulatory reform for the insurance sector as well as domestic and international payment transactions. The third pillar supports stronger fiscal management through a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) for intergenerational savings, better debt management, and improved public investment management. The first credit will be in the amount of SDR 24.4 million (US$35 million equivalent). The PDPC forms part of a developing engagement with the Co-operative Republic of Guyana spanning financial sector, fiscal, and oil and gas sector management. Complemented by the increased financial envelope due to the IDA18 Replenishment, this policy dialogue led to the development of the PDPC series as well as a now planned FY19 Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF). The first operation in the series supports the Government of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana’s (GCRG’s) strong financial sector reform efforts while recognizing through triggers the GCRG’s efforts to accelerate fiscal reform. The newfound wealth will increase demands on fiscal policy, long-term savings, and domestic investments. Fiscal policy will need to be designed to manage the additional sources of volatility in both economic activity and fiscal revenues. Although natural resource extraction has long been a feature of the Guyanese economy, the increase in discovered wealth raises the question of intergenerational savings and the extent to which revenues from extracted resources should be set aside for future generations. To the extent the wealth is not invested abroad, it must be invested wisely in the Co-operative Republic of Guyana. For the private sector that requires an efficient financial sector that allocates the resources to the most economical investments, and for public investment it requires an efficient public investment management system. The GCRG’s commitment to prudent debt management needs to be supported by a modernization and streamlining of the legislative and institutional framework.
